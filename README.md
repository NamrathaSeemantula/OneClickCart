# OneClickCart
**One-Click Cart Application with Firebase Backend**

**Description**

The One-Click Cart Application is a simple web-based application that allows users to add or remove items to their shopping cart with just a single click. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and it utilizes Firebase as the backend to store and manage the cart data.

The primary objective of this application is to provide users with a seamless and efficient shopping experience, where they can easily add items to their cart without the need for multiple clicks or navigating through complex interfaces.

**Features**

**One-Click Cart Management:** Users can add or remove items to their shopping cart with a single click, making the process quick and user-friendly.

**Real-time Updates:** The cart is synchronized in real-time with the Firebase backend, ensuring that any changes made to the cart are immediately reflected across all devices.

**Persistent Cart Data:** The cart data is stored in the Firebase database, allowing users to access their saved cart even if they log out or switch devices.

**Technologies Used**

HTML: The frontend of the application is built using HTML to structure the web pages and content.

CSS: CSS is used to style the HTML elements, providing an attractive and responsive user interface.

JavaScript: JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the application, handle cart functionality, and manage user interactions.

Firebase: Firebase serves as the backend for the application, storing cart data, and enabling real-time synchronization.
